## About Me
I’m a freelance full-stack developer completing my Bachelor of Science in Computing at Macquarie University, from which I will graduate in June 2019. I am interested in design, programming, web development, and data science. I currently teach tutorial classes at Macquarie University in ‘Fundamentals of Computer Science’ and ‘Introduction to Programming’.
